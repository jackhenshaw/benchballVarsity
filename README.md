# Benchball Varsity 2022 - Data Analysis Code
## Short Description:
Data analysis of results from a recent Benchball (sport) tournament.

## Full Description:
After a recent Benchball tournament I wished to know how the scores broke down further and how much of a definitive win Birmingham had according to different result statistics (i.e most overall points, most scored, least conceeded). Further breaking this down into the separate rules helps to determine which areas we need to work on for next years tournament too so hopefully we can win again. Finally for fun, I decided to investigate how the two Birmingham teams compared to each other (both teams played all the other teams). The aim was to have two equally skilled teams rather than a first team and second team. We see that "Team Ball" performed better on the day in all areas.

side note: Unfortunately there are a couple of games in the data base that are missing the number of people scored.

## What I learned:
- Pandas library - Started learning the pandas library to handle databases and do some basic data analysis on a particular column or row based calculations.
  - loading databases and modifying them to add extra columns
  - Summing columns and using cumsum to get an array of increasing size as the games progressed
  - Locating certain cells and checking their contents
  - Calculating the mean of a column
- Became more famaliar with Jupyter notebooks, something I have only used once before in the past.
